        "abstract": "<topic> Bioenergy deployment </topic> <gap> offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. </gap> <goal> In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, land-use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. </goal> <method> We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100EJ: high agreement; 100-300EJ: medium agreement; above 300EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245EJyr(-1) to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment (>200EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2 degrees degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. </method> <conclusion> We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options. </conclusion>",

         "abstract": "<topic> Minerals and organic matter (OM) may form intricate associations </topic> <gap> via myriad interactions. In soils, the associations of OM with mineral surfaces are mainly investigated because of their role in determining the long-term retention of OM. OM \"must decay in order to release the energy and nutrients that drive live processes all over the planet\" (Janzen, 2006). Thus, the processes and mechanisms that retain OM in soil are a central concern to very different branches of environmental research. An agronomist may want to synchronize periods of high nutrient and energy release with the growth stages of a crop. An environmental chemist may wish to either immobilize an organic soil contaminant or enhance its decomposition into less harmful metabolites, while climate scientists need to understand the processes that mediate the production of potent greenhouse gases from decomposing OM. Associations of OM with pedogenic minerals (henceforth termed mineral-organic associations (MOAs)) are known to be key controls in these and many other processes. </gap> <goal> Here we strive to present an overview of the current knowledge on MOAs and identify key questions and future research needs. </goal>",

         "abstract": "<gap> The use of pesticides made it possible to increase yields, simplify cropping systems, and forego more complicated crop protection strategies. Over-reliance on chemical control, however, is associated with contamination of ecosystems and undesirable health effects. The future of crop production is now also threatened by emergence of pest resistance and declining availability of active substances. There is therefore a need to design cropping systems less dependent on synthetic pesticides. Consequently, the European Union requires the application of <topic> eight principles (P) of Integrated Pest Management </topic> that fit within sustainable farm management. </gap> <goal> Here, we propose to farmers, advisors, and researchers a dynamic and flexible approach that accounts for the diversity of farming situations and the complexities of agroecosystems and that can improve the resilience of cropping systems and our capacity to adapt crop protection to local realities. </goal> <method> For each principle (P), we suggest that (P1) the design of inherently robust cropping systems using a combination of agronomic levers is key to prevention. (P2) Local availability of monitoring, warning, and forecasting systems is a reality to contend with. (P3) The decision-making process can integrate cropping system factors to develop longer-term strategies. (P4) The combination of non-chemical methods that may be individually less efficient than pesticides can generate valuable synergies. (P5) Development of new biological agents and products and the use of existing databases offer options for the selection of products minimizing impact on health, the environment, and biological regulation of pests. (P6) Reduced pesticide use can be effectively combined with other tactics. (P7) Addressing the root causes of pesticide resistance is the best way to find sustainable crop protection solutions. And (P8) integration of multi-season effects and trade-offs in evaluation criteria will help develop sustainable solutions. </method>",

These datasets also peg relative humidity to the maximum temperature time of day, allowing for more accurate representation of the diurnal cycle of near-surface moisture in agricultural models. AgMERRA and AgCFSR enable a number of ongoing investigations in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and related research networks, and may be used to fill gaps in historical observations as well as a basis for the generation of future climate scenarios. </conclusion>",

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for grain yield (YLD) and yield components on a wheat association mapping initiative (WAMI) population of 287 elite, spring wheat lines grown under temperate irrigated high-yield potential condition in Ciudad Obregn, Mexico, during four crop cycles (from 2009-2010 to 2012-2013). The population was genotyped with high-density Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assay. </method> <conclusion> An analysis of traits across subpopulations indicated that lines with 1B/1R translocation had higher YLD, grain weight, and taller plants than lines without the translocation. GWAS using 18,704 SNPs identified 31 loci that explained 5-14 % of the variation in individual traits. We identified SNPs in chromosome 5A and 6A that were significantly associated with yield and yield components. Four loci were detected for YLD in chromosomes 3B, 5A, 5B, and 6A and the locus in 5A explained 5 % of the variation for grain number/m(2). The locus for YLD in chromosome 6A also explained 6 % of the variation in grain weight. Loci significantly associated with maturity were identified in chromosomes 2B, 3B, 4B, 4D, and 6A and for plant height in 1A and 6A. Loci were also detected for canopy temperature at grain filling (2D, 4D, 6A), chlorophyll index at grain filling (3B and 6A), biomass (3D and 6A) and harvest index (1D, 1B, and 3B) that explained 5-10 % variation. These markers will be further validated. </conclusion>",

Despite this fact, there has been relatively little discussion about how events become meaningful and come to impact organizations across space and time. </gap> <method> We address this gap by developing event system theory, which suggests that events become salient when they are novel, disruptive, and critical (reflecting an event's strength). Importantly, events can originate at any hierarchical level and their effects can remain within that level or travel up or down throughout the organization, changing or creating new behaviors, features, and events. </method> <conclusion> This impact can extend over time as events vary in duration and timing or as event strength evolves. Event system theory provides a needed shift in focus for organizational theory and research by developing specific propositions articulating the interplay among event strength and the spatial and temporal processes through which events come to influence organizations. </conclusion>",

These themes emerged inductively because they either represent areas with consistent results, a large proliferation of studies, or a grouping of studies and results that differed from where the literature stood a decade ago. Following the review section, we turn our attention toward 10 opportunities for future research: study setting, generational impacts, methodological considerations, new and emerging technologies, member mobility, subgroups, team adaptation, transition processes and planning, creativity, and team member well-being. Some of these opportunities emerged from our review of the extant VT literature; others are grounded in the broader team literature, are unresolved theoretical issues, or were linked to insights discussed within the VT practitioner literature. </method> <conclusion> Within the domain of VTs, technological innovation continues to advance the way team members interact and enable individuals who previously could not be connected to work together as a team.

By examining the interpretation of one such statement - namely, Next Wednesday's meeting has been moved forward by two days - earlier research has demonstrated that people may draw on spatial perspectives, involving multiple spatially based temporal reference strategies, to interpret metaphoric statements about time (e.g. Boroditsky 2000; Kranjec 2006; McGlone and Harding 1998; Nunez et al. 2006). However, what is still missing is an understanding of the role of linguistic factors in the interpretation of temporal statements such as this one. </gap> <goal> In this paper, we examine the linguistic properties of this famous temporally ambiguous utterance, considered as an instantiation of a more schematic construction. </goal> <method> In Experiment 1, we examine the roles of individual lexical items that are used in the utterance in order to better understand the interplay of lexical semantics and constructional meaning in the context of a metaphoric statement. Following up on prior suggestions in the literature, we ask whether the locus of the ambiguity is centred on the adverb, centred on the verb, or distributed across the utterance. <conclusion> The results suggest that the final interpretation results from an interplay of verb and adverb, suggesting a distributed temporal semantics analogous to the distributed semantics noted for the metaphoric source domain of space (Sinha and Kuteva 1995) and consistent with a constructional view of language (Goldberg 2003). In Experiment 2, we expand the linguistic factors under investigation to include voice and person. </method> The findings suggest that grammatical person, but not grammatical voice, may also influence the interpretation of the Next Wednesday's meeting metaphor.

        "abstract": "<goal> This paper introduces an innovative method to aid the study of <topic> conceptual onomasiological </topic> research, with a specific emphasis on diachronic variation in the metonymic patterns with which a target concept is expressed. </goal> <method> We illustrate how the method is applied to explore and visualize such diachronic changes by means of a case study on the metonymic patterns for WOMAN in the history of Chinese. Visualization is done with the help of a Multidimensional Scaling solution based on the profile-based distance calculation (Geeraerts et al. 1999; Speelman et al. 2003) and by drawing diachronic trajectories in a set of MDS maps, corresponding to different metonymic targets. This method proves to be effective and feasible in detecting changes in the distribution of metonymic patterns in authentic historical corpus data. On the basis of this method, we can show that different targets exhibit different degrees of diachronic variation in their metonymic patterns. We find diachronically more stable targets (e.g. IMPERIAL WOMAN), targets with a dominant trend in diachronic variation (e.g. A WOMAN), and targets with highly fluctuating historical variation (e.g. BEAUTIFUL WOMAN). Importantly, we can identify the cultural and social changes that may lie behind some of these changes. </method> <conclusion> Examining the results uncovered by the method offers us a better understanding of the dynamicity of metonymic conceptualizations. </conclusion>",

Whereas several scholars have acknowledged this potential, the question as to how speakers' gestures can be incorporated in CG-based grammatical analysis has not been conclusively addressed. </gap> <goal> In this paper, we aim to advance the CG-gesture relationship. </goal> <method> We first elaborate on three important points of convergence between CG and gesture research: (1) CG's conception of grammar as a prototype category, with central and more peripheral structures, aligns with the variable degrees to which speakers' gestures are conventionalized in human communication. (2) Conceptualization, which lies at the basis of grammatical organization according to CG, is known to be of central importance for gestural expression. In fact, all of the main dimensions of construal postulated in CG (specificity, perspective, profile-base relationship, conceptual archetypes) receive potential gestural expression. (3) CG's intensive use of diagrammatic notation allows for the incorporation of spatial features of gestures. Subsequently, we demonstrate how CG can be applied to analyze the structure of multimodal, spoken-gestured utterances. </method> <conclusion> These analyses suggest that the constructs and tools developed by CG can be employed to analyze the compositionality that exists within a single gesture (between conventional and more idiosyncratic components) as well as in the grammatical relations that may exist between gesture and speech. Finally, we raise a number of theoretical and empirical challenges. </conclusion>",

There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. </gap> <goal> In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. </goal> <method> We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures.

Various minor damage scenarios are created for the 3-D structures to investigate the newly proposed multiobjective approach. The proposed hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm detects the exact locations and extents of the induced minor damages in the structure. Even though it uses incomplete mode shapes, which do not have any measured information at the damaged element, the proposed approach detects damage well. The robustness of the proposed method is investigated by adding 5% Gaussian random white noise as a noise effect to mode shapes, which are used in the calculation ofMSE. </conclusion>",

The automatic segmentation of the vessel tree is an important pre-processing step which facilitates subsequent automatic processes that contribute to such diagnosis. </gap> <goal> We introduce a novel method for the automatic segmentation of vessel trees in retinal fundus images. We propose a filter that selectively responds to vessels and that we call B-COSFIRE with B standing for bar which is an abstraction for a vessel. </goal> <method>  It is based on the existing COSFIRE (Combination Of Shifted Filter Responses) approach. A B-COSFIRE filter achieves orientation selectivity by computing the weighted geometric mean of the output of a pool of Difference-of-Gaussians filters, whose supports are aligned in a collinear manner. It achieves rotation invariance efficiently by simple shifting operations. The proposed filter is versatile as its selectivity is determined from any given vessel-like prototype pattern in an automatic configuration process. We configure two B-COSFIRE filters, namely symmetric and asymmetric, that are selective for bars and bar-endings, respectively. We achieve vessel segmentation by summing up the responses of the two rotation-invariant B-COSFIRE filters followed by thresholding. </method> <conclusion> The results that we achieve on three publicly available data sets (DRIVE: Se = 0.7655, Sp = 0.9704; STARE: Se = 0.7716, Sp = 0.9701; CHASE_DB1: Se = 0.7585, Sp = 0.9587) are higher than many of the state-of-the-art methods.

In addition, flow reactor speciation data recorded for the pyrolysis and oxidation of isobutene is also reported. Predictions of an updated kinetic model described herein are compared with each of these data sets, as well as with existing jet-stirred reactor (JSR) species measurements.    IDTs of isobutene oxidation were measured in four different shock tubes and in two rapid compression machines (RCMs) under conditions of relevance to practical combustors. The combination of shock tube and RCM data greatly expands the range of available validation data for isobutene oxidation models to pressures of 50 atm and temperatures in the range 666-1715 K. Isobutene flame speeds were measured experimentally at 1 atm and at unburned gas temperatures of 298-398 K over a wide range of equivalence ratios. For the flame speed results, there was good agreement between different facilities and the current model in the fuel-rich region. Ab initio chemical kinetics calculations were carried out to calculate rate constants for important reactions such as H-atom abstraction by hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals and the decomposition of 2-methylallyl radicals.    A comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed to describe the combustion of isobutene and is validated by comparison to the presently considered experimental measurements. Important reactions, highlighted via flux and sensitivity analyses, include: (a) hydrogen atom abstraction from isobutene by hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals, and molecular oxygen; (b) radical-radical recombination reactions, including 2-methylallyl radical self-recombination, the recombination of 2-methylallyl radicals with hydroperoxyl radicals; and the recombination of 2-methylallyl radicals with methyl radicals; (c) addition reactions, including hydrogen atom and hydroxyl radical addition to isobutene; and (d) 2-methylallyl radical decomposition reactions. The current mechanism accurately predicts the IDT and LFS measurements presented in this study, as well as the JSR and flow reactor speciation data already available in the literature.    The differences in low-temperature chemistry between alkanes and alkenes are also highlighted. in this work. In normal alkanes, the fuel radical (R) over dot adds to molecular oxygen forming alkylperoxyl (R(O) over dot(2)) radicals followed by isomerization and chain branching reactions which promote low-temperature fuel reactivity. However, in alkenes, because of the relatively shallow well (similar to 20 kcal mol(-1)) for R(O) over dot(2) formation compared to similar to 35 kcal mol(-1) in alkanes, the (R) over dot+O-2 (sic) R(O) over dot(2) equilibrium lies more to the left favoring (R) over dot+O-2 rather than R(O) over dot(2) radical stabilization. </method> <conclusion> Based on this work, and related studies of allylic systems, it is apparent that reactivity for alkene components at very low temperatures (<800 K) emanates from hydroxyl radical addition followed by addition of molecular oxygen to radical. At intermediate temperatures (800-1300 K), alkene reactivity is controlled by hydrogen abstraction by molecular oxygen and the reactions between resonantly stabilized radicals and hydroperoxyl radicals which results in chain branching. At higher temperatures (>1300 K), the reactivity is mainly governed by the competition between hydrogen abstractions by molecular oxygen and OH radicals. </conclusion>",

In the period January 1, 1986, to December 4, 2015, PubMed tags 266,782 items as systematic reviews and 58,611 as meta-analyses. Annual publications between 1991 and 2014 increased 2,728% for systematic reviews and 2,635% for meta-analyses versus only 153% for all PubMed-indexed items. Currently, probably more systematic reviews of trials than new randomized trials are published annually. Most topics addressed by meta-analyses of randomized trials have overlapping, redundant meta-analyses; same-topic meta-analyses may exceed 20 sometimes. Some fields produce massive numbers of meta-analyses; for example, 185 meta-analyses of antidepressants for depression were published between 2007 and 2014. These meta-analyses are often produced either by industry employees or by authors with industry ties and results are aligned with sponsor interests. China has rapidly become the most prolific producer of English-language, PubMed-indexed meta-analyses. The most massive presence of Chinese meta-analyses is on genetic associations (63% of global production in 2014), where almost all results are misleading since they combine fragmented information from mostly abandoned era of candidate genes. Furthermore, many contracting companies working on evidence synthesis receive industry contracts to produce meta-analyses, many of which probably remain unpublished. Many other meta-analyses have serious flaws. Of the remaining, most have weak or insufficient evidence to inform decision making. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses are both non-misleading and useful. \n Conclusions \n The production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has reached epidemic proportions. Possibly, the large majority of produced systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unnecessary, misleading, and/or conflicted. </conclusion>",

         "abstract": "<goal> Purpose \n <gap> Despite sincere commitment to egalitarian, meritocratic principles, subtle gender bias persists, constraining women's opportunities for academic advancement. </gap> The authors implemented a pair-matched, single-blind, cluster randomized, controlled study of a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention at a large public university. </goal> \n <method> Method \n Participants were faculty in 92 departments or divisions at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Between September 2010 and March 2012, experimental departments were offered a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention as a 2.5-hour workshop. Surveys measured gender bias awareness; motivation, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations to reduce bias; and gender equity action. A timed word categorization task measured implicit gender/leadership bias. Faculty completed a work life survey before and after all experimental departments received the intervention. Control departments were offered workshops after data were collected. </method> \n <conclusion> Results \n Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly greater changes post intervention for faculty in experimental versus control departments on several outcome measures, including self-efficacy to engage in gender-equity-promoting behaviors (P=.013). When 25% of a department's faculty attended the workshop (26 of 46 departments), significant increases in self-reported action to promote gender equity occurred at three months (P =.007). Post intervention, faculty in experimental departments expressed greater perceptions of fit (P=.024), valuing of their research (P=.019), and comfort in raising personal and professional conflicts (P =.025). \n Conclusions \n An intervention that facilitates intentional behavioral change can help faculty break the gender bias habit and change department climate in ways that should support the career advancement of women in academic medicine, science, and engineering. </conclusion> \n",

Despite a move towards emphasizing speech intelligibility and comprehensibility, most research surveyed promoted native-like pronunciation as the target. Although most studies entailed classroom instruction, many featured Computer Assisted Pronunciation Teaching (CAPT). Segmentals were studied more often than suprasegmentals. The amount of instruction required to effect change was related to researchers' goals; interventions focusing on a single feature were generally shorter than those addressing more issues. Reading-aloud tasks were the most common form of assessment; very few studies measured spontaneous speech. The attribution of improvement as a result of instruction was compromised in some instances by lack of a control group. </method> <conclusion> We summarize our findings, highlight limitations of current research, and offer suggestions for future directions. </conclusion>",

Despite being observed only a decade ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics, as standard spin-current generators and detectors. </gap> <goal> Here the theoretical and experimental results that have established this subfield of spintronics are reviewed. </goal> <method> The focus is on the results that have converged to give us the current understanding of the phenomena, which has evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement of spin currents and their associated spin accumulation. Within the experimental framework, optical-, transport-, and magnetization-dynamics-based measurements are reviewed and linked to both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework, the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regimes are reviewed, which are linked to the mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. Also reviewed is the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin generation used in many measurements of the spin Hall angle. A further connection to the spin-current-generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect is given, in which an electrical current induces a nonequilibrium spin polarization. This effect often accompanies the spin Hall effect since they share common microscopic origins. Both can exhibit the same symmetries when present in structures comprising ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers through their induced current-driven spin torques or induced voltages. Although a short chronological overview of the evolution of the spin Hall effect field and the resolution of some early controversies is given, the main body of this review is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established and accepted physics. </method> <conclusion> In such a young field, there remains much to be understood and explored, hence some of the future challenges and opportunities of this rapidly evolving area of spintronics are outlined. </conclusion>",
